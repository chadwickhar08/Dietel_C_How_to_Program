/*(Sales Commission Calculator) One large chemical company pays its salespeople on a com-
mission basis. The salespeople receive $200 per week plus 9% of their gross sales for that week. For
example, a salesperson who sells $5000 worth of chemicals in a week receives $200 plus 9% of
$5000, or a total of $650. Develop a program that will input each salespersonâ€™s gross sales for last
week and will calculate and display that salesperson's earnings.*/
